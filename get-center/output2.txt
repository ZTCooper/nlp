"they're the first really high temperatures to hit northern china this year," said fang chong, chief forecaster at the national meteorological center.
residents in cities from at least eight northern provinces are also experiencing their first heat wave of the year, the national weather authority said on wednesday.
temperatures from wednesday to friday will climb as high as 40 c in parts of the inner mongolia autonomous region and reach 37 c in the vast regions in north china on friday, she said.
"these regions, from inner mongolia to northern areas like hebei and henan, have been hit by high temperatures because of the west-to-east movement of a continental warm air mass, which brings sunny days with little rainfall," said he lifu, another chief forecaster of the national weather authority.
temperatures in the capital were higher than the average for the same period in recent years, but they're short of the record - 38.1 c on may 19, 2010. though may is only half over, beijing has entered summer, as determined by consecutive warm days.
